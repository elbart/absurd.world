# How all started
All started while listening to a german podcast [Logbuch Netzpolitik][lnp] while being on vacation at lake Chiemsee in Bavaria, Germany. It came to my mind, that it can't be just normal to only consume the absurdities I listen and read in podcasts, on twitter and in the news recently. Absurdities, because the regular people are longing for change to prevent such dramatic climate change science is telling about again and again (see the latest [IPCC SR15 report][ipcc-sr15]). However current politicians at least in Germnay seem to be reluctant, to agree on the changes, required for reaching the goals of the [Paris Agreement][paris-agreement] to avoid irrevertible changes to planet earth.

# What this is all about
This blog works as a method to reflect my learnings from the current news scenery and especially about the absurdities of the discussions which are going on between the demanding people and the rather blocking old economy politicians while running into the possibly largest mass extinction drama, the world has seen since humanity rose.
